# Roche Stock Quantitative Analysis

This project aims to predict Roche stock prices using regression analysis on time series data and machine learning modeling. By gathering microeconomic and macroeconomic data from publicly available APIs and incorporating financial statements from company websites, the goal is to create accurate predictions for stock prices. In contrast to a fundamental analysis, this project is a deep dive into the mathematics and modeling behind the numbers.
